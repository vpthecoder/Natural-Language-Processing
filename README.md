Strengths of python in text processing is that there are lots of libraries, dynamic typing, 
and lots of built-in string methods to work with strings. A weakness could be that a large program could be slower to run compared to C++ or Java since it is interpreted. 

I learned about pickling and and system arguments in python. The syntax of Python and using regular expressions and classes was a review for me since I had experience with it.

It then finds the lemmas and attaches pos taggers to them. It then selects all the nouns and puts them in a list. It then returns the list of nouns and tokens to the main function. The 50 most common nouns are selected
and used to implement a guessing game similar to hangman.

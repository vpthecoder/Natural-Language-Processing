## Assignment 1

This is an assignment 1. The program takes in text from a file and formats it using regex to the required format. It runs in pycharm after a system argument is manually inputted.

Strengths of python in text processing is that there are lots of libraries, dynamic typing, 
and lots of built-in string methods to work with strings. A weakness could be that a large program could be slower to run compared to C++ or Java since it is interpreted. 

I learned about pickling and and system arguments in python. The syntax of Python and using regular expressions and classes was a review for me since I had experience with it.
